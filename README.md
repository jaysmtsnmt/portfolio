# Self Introduction
Hello! I am Jayden Soh, a Year 5 student studying in VJC. 👋

My <ins> passion for engineering started when I was young </ins>, when my father bought an electronics kit for beginners, consisting of a simple Arduino Uno, with basic components such as LEDs 🚨, LCDs & Buttons 🔘. I had just moved to Switzerland then (as my father got a job there), where the <ins>IB curriculum had given me space & time to explore more into that area.</ins> One of my first projects was a very simple door alarm system 🔔, where I had used a button, chopsticks and string to detect the opening of a door! Then, as I gained more experience, <ins>I learnt how to code- in C++ & Python</ins>, which unlocked an entire realm of new possibilities. 

**In Secondary School** (back in Singapore), <ins>I also started to explore leadership</ins>, where I served as a class monitor, peer support leader and on the Prefects' Council Executive Comittee. But outside of all that, the thing I still enjoyed the most was engineering 🛠️. During the holidays (when I had the motivation), I would restart my personal projects- to draw ✏️, tinker 🔨, build and code 💻. Most of my projects started from my imagination, for example- <ins>my companion robot CT-02</ins>, where I really really wanted to recreate Jarvis. (obviously didnt work to that extent), while some are for school competitions, for example- the <ins>Modular Fogponics Greenhouse</ins>. Some of the projects which I worked the hardest on were for school assignments, such as the RC cardboard mariokart. 🚗

But now that I am older, I realise the importance of fueling and keeping this passion, as it will be a great asset for my future. I do not want to lose these skills, and I recognise that the priorities that I set in my JC life will play a crucial role in the development of my engineering passion. 

**Hence, my reason for applying for the Computing course in VJC** is to further develop my skills in this area, be it coding, building or designing, and to <ins>further give me the space & time to grow this passion</ins>.

# My Projects
## CT-02
CT-02 was inspired by all the Star Wars robots & Jarvis from Iron Man. I wanted to create a robot that could 
1. See it's surroundings
2. Be able to understand speech
3. Be able to help my complete daily tasks, such as music controls, alarm setting, calendar setting etc.
4. Be cute

CT is coded in two languages, C++ & Python. C++ is used for the hardware side, where it is ran completely on the Arduino, while Python is used for the software & processing side. 

### C++/Hardware
The most important segment of the C++ code is to recieve serial commands via USB, understand those serial commands, and execute the actions accordingly, physically changing the state of the robot. The robot a few "body parts"
1. Eyes (Left Blue, Right Blue, Left Red, Right Red)
2. Heart
3. Neck (Servo)
4. Camera (actual webcam)

I wanted the robot to have a very natural design, so its main body only comprises of one square (head), and a rectangle (body). It's eyes are made out of hotglue (I made a baking paper mold) and has LEDs mounted into it. The blinking of the eyes can be seen as the LEDs blink, but I made it more natural by giving each LED a slight delay from each other. (so it actually looks like it is blinking!) 

Here is an early version of CT-02 being awakened by a button press:
